The Challenge
=============

The rules are simple: create a functioning Tic Tac Toe game using nothing but HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  The game must work in at least one modern web browser. A complete list of requirements and restriction follows:

* You are not allowed to use anything but Notepad (or whatever crude text editor your system may provide)
* Your text editor may not do any typing for you (code completing, etc)
* You are not allowed to use any libraries, plugins, etc. (no jQuery, CSS Bootstrap, etc.)
* You are not allowed to use any existing code (not even code you previously wrote for this same Tic Tac Toe coding challenge)
* You must use the timestamp set by the system to calculate your total time (once the game is finished, tested, and follows all the rules of the game)
* The game must work as expected (account for wins and draws)
* The game must provide some sort of indication (text or audio) about the following events:

1. Whose turn it is
2. Who won (if someone won the game)
3. The game ended on a draw (if thatâ€™s the case)
4. If an invalid move was attempted (example, the player tries to check an already occupied square)

* The game must stop once it ends (no squares should be marked/unmarked once the game is over)
